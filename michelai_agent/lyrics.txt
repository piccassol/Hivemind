[verse]
Staring at the sunset, colors paint the sky
Thoughts of you keep swirling, can't deny
I know I let you down, I made mistakes
But I'm here to mend the heart I didn't break

[chorus]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down
You know you can't deny it now
I won't back down

[verse]
They might say I'm foolish, chasing after you
But they don't feel this love the way we do
My heart beats only for you, can't you see?
I won't let you slip away from me

[chorus]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down
You know you can't deny it now
I won't back down

[bridge]
No, I won't back down, won't turn around
Until you're back where you belong
I'll cross the oceans wide, stand by your side
Together we are strong

[outro]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, love's the tie that binds
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down
