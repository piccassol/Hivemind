AuroraRift is a decentralized framework and platform built on the Solana blockchain, focused on the creation and management of Music, Video, and Picture NFTs. The project aims to offer artists a seamless, secure, and efficient way to mint, distribute, and monetize their creations through NFTs, while also integrating with popular streaming & media services and social media platforms for promotion. Key features include:
	- Multi-Chain Support: Initially focused on Solana, with potential future integration of additional blockchains.
 - NFT Minting and Royalty Management: Smart contracts enforce royalties (via EIP-2981) and enable decentralized art ownership. Metadata for each NFT is hosted on IPFS to ensure permanence and access.
 - Streaming and Media Service Integration: Connects with popular platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Youtube, Tiktok, Instagram, Meta, Magic Eden, X,  Exchange.art) to streamline the integration of creative content with NFT ownership.
 - Marketing Automation: Automated tools to share NFT drops and music content across social media platforms like Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Meta) leveraging social media APIs to enhance community engagement.
 - Blockchain Infrastructure and Security: Strong focus on security with key management through HSMs, gas optimization strategies, and transaction batching to reduce costs.
 - Testing and Deployment: Rigorous testing and multi-chain deployment capabilities, including smart contract audits and load testing.

AuroraRift is designed to empower musicians, artists, and creators by providing them with a robust, decentralized ecosystem to manage, sell, and promote their digital assets directly to their audiences while ensuring fair compensation through royalties and transparent ownership tracking.
